It's been quite a while since I've forgotten to learn, think and practice for an year.


- At the beginnig of the year **2020** i planned for few things that i would target on that year. But due to pandemic started working from home. At the start of pandemic it looks good as day's prolong i was not comfortable and had lot of tension and stress.

- In mid of the year i started my javascript library **COBB** on behalf of the place where i stayed.And to the surprise i started a youtube channel named **JunkCast7**.

- From the work perspective i was totally occupied. Due to the situation and peer pressure worked around the clock. Voice and thoughts was not recognized instead the 90's ideas are getting implanted.

- I purchased UX tools and started paper prototyping for few of my works.

- Started writing a CSS framework named yellow later i skipped.

- So far 2020 is not great for me
