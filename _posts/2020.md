This was my second official blog, prior to this one i was active for a long on my first blog [genlinux.org](#http://www.genlinux.org/). I tried to write my writings on medium and found quite boring as i dont have the flexibility to change my theme.
 
Things i did at the mid of 2019

1. Started writing javascript utility library Cobb
2. kickstarted my thoughts on my long term review project
3. Learned how to contribute on open source projects
4. About product UX design.

# December 2019

I cloned gatsby project and started working on customizing the gatsby to develop my blog on Gatsby.I found 
the gatsby blog ([overreacted.io] #https://overreacted.io/ and [hswolf] #https://hswolff.com/ ) are very helpful including the gatsby-blog-core.
